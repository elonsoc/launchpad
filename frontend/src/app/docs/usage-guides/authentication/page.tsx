					Authentication is a crucial step in interacting with the Open Data
					Service (ODS) API. This guide will walk you through the authentication
					process, ensuring secure access to the data about Elon University.
					Open Data Service utilizes a single sign-on (SSO) approach to be able
					to register for applications combined with an API key for
					authentication.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section aria-labelledby='Single_Sign-On'>
				<h2 id='Single_Sign-On'>Single Sign-On (SSO)</h2>
				<p>
					ODS leverages the Elon University Single Sign-On (SSO) system for user
					authentication. To access the API or an API key, you need to have a
					valid Elon University account. By utilizing your Elon University
					credentials, you can authenticate and gain authorized access to the
					ODS API resources. This SSO approach ensures a seamless and secure
					authentication process.

					Including API Key in Requests
				</h2>
				<p>
					In addition to the SSO authentication, you also need to include your
					API key in the requests to authenticate your API calls. After logging
					in via SSO and obtaining your API key, you should include it in the
					"Authorization" header of your API requests. The API key serves as a
					unique identifier for your application and grants you access to the
					protected resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					The API key should be included using the "Bearer" authentication
					method, such as:
				</p>
				<p className='code'>Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY</p>
				<p>
					Ensure that you replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key
					obtained from your registered application.
				</p>

			<section aria-labelledby='Authentication_Example'>
				<h2 id='Authentication_Example'>Authentication Example</h2>
				<p>
					Here's an example of an API request using cURL, including the API key
					in the header:
				</p>
				<CodeCopyable
					code={`curl -X GET http://api.ods.elon.edu/v1/buildings/ -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"`}
				/>
				<p>Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.</p>

				<p>
					Follow the instructions provided in this guide to ensure proper
					authentication when interacting with the ODS API. By authenticating
					your API calls including the API key in the 'Authorization' header,
					you can securely access the data about Elon University and unlock its
					full potential. If you have any further questions or require
					additional support, our team is here to assist you throughout the
