						: Authentication is a crucial aspect of working with the ODS API.
						This guide will walk you through the various authentication methods
						supported by the API. It will provide step-by-step instructions on
						how to authenticate your API requests, ensuring secure and
						authorized access to the data. Understanding and implementing
						authentication correctly is essential for protecting sensitive
						information and maintaining data integrity.

                        : To ensure fair usage and maintain optimal performance, the ODS API
                        enforces rate limits. This guide will explain how rate limits work,
                        including the specific limits applicable to your account or
                        application. You will learn strategies to effectively manage and
                        optimize your API usage within these limits, preventing any
                        disruptions in accessing the data. Understanding rate limits will help
                        you design efficient and scalable applications that make the most out
                        of the ODS API.

							Error Handling
						</Link>
						: While working with APIs, encountering errors is inevitable. This
						guide will provide an overview of the different types of errors you
						might encounter when interacting with the ODS API and how to handle
						them gracefully. It will cover common error codes, error response
						formats, and best practices for error handling in your applications.
						Understanding and properly handling errors will enhance the
						reliability and robustness of your integrations with the ODS API.
