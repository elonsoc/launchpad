// This file contains the definition of the Service struct
// which is used to define the various services that we will be using
// in a dependency injection pattern.
// A dependency injection pattern defines the services that we will be using
// in a generalized way, and then we can pass the services around by reference
// to the various functions that need them.
// This allows us to define the services in one place, and then use them
// in any function that needs them as well as change the services that we are using
// in one place, and have those changes reflected in all of the functions that use them.

// By separating the services into their own file, we can focus the different packages
// on their specific tasks, and not have to worry about the services that they are using.
